This is a R code to analyze normalized counts for TG neurons from our 12-month-old rats. 
These are neurons that innervate the TMJ capsule of normal animals. 
Experimental method: We injected DiI into the TMJ and then patch clamped the labeled neurons. 
These data are individual neurons (no non-neuronal cells)  where we ran RNA_Seq on them after patch clamping  (Patch-Seq).
